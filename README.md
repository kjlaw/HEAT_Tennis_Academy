H.E.A.T. Tennis Academy
=======================

This is an archive of the H.E.A.T. Tennis Academy website. (July 2014)

I built this website in April 2010 and have continued to maintain it until July 2014. 

H.E.A.T Tennis Academy offers summer camps and practice sessions for tennis players of all levels. The purpose of this website is for players to have a convenient way to access information about the coaching staff, schedule, tuition, location, and announcements. I used an interactive map that displays the academyâ€™s location with current weather information at that location. I also added a Twitter feed to display schedule and location changes due to weather. Using Adobe Flash, I customized a Flash template and added it to the intro page as requested. I also set up social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter for this academy and designed promotional brochures.
